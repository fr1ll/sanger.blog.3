We had a "cocktail off" cocktail competition to commemorate the double junction of Subaru and Jupiter. My entrant was a [Kyoto Sour](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kyoto-sour/ "Kyoto Sour recipe at liquor.com") modified by switching the hot sauce and a couple other details. Here's how to make it!

## Ingredients

* 2 thicky slices grapefruit
* 4 dashes "Yuzu-It" yuzu pepper sauce (or similar)
* 3 ounces Sho-Une Junmai Dai Ginjo sake (or similar)
* 1/2 ounce lemon juice, preferably fresh
* 3/4 ounce Agave nectar
* Crushed ice
* Garnish with grapefruit slice and fresh mint

## Smash the grapefruit to the hot sauce

First make sure everything is clean and ready to go.

Cut the grapefruit slices into chunks and add to cocktail mixer. More grapefruit more better. The better grapefruit the better it's all gonna be.

Dash in hot sauce, then use something blunt to smash it all up. Smash it pretty good, you don't wanna leave juice on the table.

## Add rest of ingredients
