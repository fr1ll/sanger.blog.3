We had a "cocktail off" cocktail competition to commemorate the double junction of Subaru and Jupiter. My entrant was a [Kyoto Sour](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kyoto-sour/ "Kyoto Sour recipe at liquor.com") modified by switching the hot sauce and a couple other details. Here's how to make it!

## Ingredients

* 2 thicky slices grapefruit
* 4 dashes "Yuzu-It" yuzu pepper sauce (or similar)
* 3 ounces Sho-Une Junmai Dai Ginjo sake (or similar), preferably chilled
* 1/2 ounce lemon juice, preferably fresh
* 3/4 ounce Agave nectar
* Crushed ice
* Garnish with grapefruit slice and fresh mint

## Smash the grapefruit to the hot sauce

First make sure everything is clean and ready to go.

Cut the grapefruit slices into chunks and add to cocktail shaker. More grapefruit more better. The better grapefruit the better it's all gonna be.

Dash in hot sauce, then use something blunt to smash it all up. Smash it pretty good, you don't wanna leave juice on the table.

## Add rest of ingredients and shake

Measure in sake, agave nectar, and lemon juice. Fresh lemon is much nicer than old fridge-born(e) lemon.

### Crush up the ice

Use a big spoon to crush up the ice in your hand. Add so the cocktail mixer has about an inch of room at the top.

### Shake it!

Your goal is to get everything really nice and cold. "Don't unwrap or it's in your lap!"

## Pour and garnish

Pour as much as you can get out into your glass.

Rinse, then slap the mint to get some life into it. Garnish with the mint and grapefruit slice.
